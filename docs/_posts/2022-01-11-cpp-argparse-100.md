I am pleased to announce the latest and greatest release of 
[**cpp-argparse**](https://github.com/kkarbowiak/cpp-argparse). This new version
is 1.0.0, which means that it contains all the features that I intended it to
have.

## What is it?

Just to recap, cpp-argparse is a reimplementation of the Python's
[`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) module. It is
a header-only, single-include library with no external dependencies. It just
uses STL and requires C++17. It is released under MIT license

## What are the new features?

Comparing to the previous version that I announced on this blog
([0.8.3](https://kkarbowiak.github.io/docs/programming/cpp-argparse-083/)),
this one adds the following:
 * support for mutually exclusive groups
 * detection of errors during string to type (e.g. to int) conversion
 * support for multiple optional argument names

The above are nice additions, but I think the most important is the...

## Tutorial

The latest version sports a
[tutorial](https://github.com/kkarbowiak/cpp-argparse/blob/master/tutorial/readme.md),
which gently introduces the library and its features, showing the usage on many
examples.

## What else?

Not much. The library now contains all that I intended it to, so apart from a
bug fix here and there (hopefully the number of bugs is minimal) I do not plan
major development.

Could the code be improved? Sure, but I think at the moment the functionality
is more important and it's there.

So, enjoy parsing your command-line args!
