Hi, I am Krzysiek Karbowiak and this is my blog. I am a programmer, a husband, and a father.[^1] I program mostly in C++ and Python, but I did play around with Assembler, Basic, C, Haskell, Pascal, and Prolog as well.

I started my professional career in 2007, but my interest in programming goes back much further. Yes, I am old enough to have owned and 8-bit computer.

I love symmetries and analogies, especially if they help me reason about programs or explain them to others. I like sharing my experience and learning new things.

On this blog I will share my thoughts on programming, technology, and stuff I find interesting.

Stay tuned.
